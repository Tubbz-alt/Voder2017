the graphics-core folder is a subproject to add a GUI to the Voder2017 project

in the bin folder i have provided an quick_install.sh to install the depends for the GUI subproject. 

currently the only depends being used are libglfw3 and libglfw3-dev. These will add 
the ability to make a window and get user input form the keyboard or mouse. 

once the core graphics has been written the two projects can be merged togeher and 
unified.
